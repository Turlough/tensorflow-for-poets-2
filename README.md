# Overview

## Summary
Forked from [TensorFlow for poets 2](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2) series of codelabs.

Added bash scripts for quick processing

## Scripts
### split_video.sh
Accepts a directory name as parameter, locates all mp4 files in that directory, creates an output directory within 'training_sets' and outputs jpegs (4 per second of video) into the output directory.

Take about a minute of video of an object to be added to the training set, circumnavigating it to capture it from all angles. 
Copy the video to say, downloads, then invoke: 
```./split_video.sh ~/downloads```

### retrain.sh
Retrains the model against the subdirectories of 'training_sets', which updates the base graph file, 'retrained_graph.pb'.
If you have uploaded a video, and split it with the previous script, it will be trained into the new graph.

### update_assets.sh
Creates 'optimized_graph.pb' from 'retrained_graph.pb'. Creates 'rounded_graph.pb' from 'optimized_graph.pb'. 
The rounded graph is copied to the assets folder of the Android project. Rebuild the project with the updated graph.

### test_results.sh
Tests recognition of all files in the 'test_images' folder against the three .pb files generated by the previous script.
Add a sample image from any new directories, or another image that should be recognised, to the 'test_images' directory to ensure that all graphs process with reasonable accuracy.
